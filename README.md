# Course work from Hell
It's the first year of National aviation university, discipline "Object-oriented programming".  
The task was to implement some system, I have football management system. The system must be controlled through the
console and have Model-View-Controller architecture or just Model-View.

# How to use?
All commands and their explanation are given in runtime. So just follow instructions.  
Project serializes and deserializes all data, so work without fear of data loss.
